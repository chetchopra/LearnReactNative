# LearnReactNative

## About
This is a React Native app aimed at teaching users more about data structures. You can read up on them and even answer questions about them. 

## Demo
I'm currently working on a live demo but in the meantime you can checkout out a quick demo on youtube

## Usage 

1. Clone or fork the repo

2. Run `npm install` to install all the needed dependencies to the node_modules folder

3. You can use your simulator of choice but I used the simulator that comes with xcode

4. Run `react-native run-ios` - this will start the simulator

5. You will need a backend to connect to. That can be found at https://github.com/chetchopra/LearnAPI
